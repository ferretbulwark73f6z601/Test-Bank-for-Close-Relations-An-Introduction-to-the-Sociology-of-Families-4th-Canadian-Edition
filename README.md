  * Close Relations stresses family process over structure, diversity over uniformity, and reality over myth. This Canadian text explores the new kinds of family relations and forms created by shifting patterns and demands of work in post-modern societies. Close Relations is unique in its focus on applications and theory: what works for families, for us as individuals, and for society.
